The Open/Closed Principle is one of five design principles for object-oriented software development described by Robert C. Martin.
Robert C. Martin considered this principle as the “the most important principle of object-oriented design”.
But he wasn’t the first one who defined it. Bertrand Meyer wrote about it in 1988 in his book Object-Oriented Software Construction.

Example of Open/Closed principle:

//Poor design

class Shape {
	public double calculateArea(Shape[] shapes) {
		double area = 0;
		for(Shape shape:shapes) {
			if(shape instanceof Rectangle) {
				//Calculate Area of Rectange
			}
			else if(shape instanceof Circle) {
				//Calculate Area of Circle
			}
		}
		return area;
	}
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
	
}

class Circle extends Shape {
	
	
}

//Better version 

abstract class Shape {

	
    abstract double area();
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {

	@Override
	double area() {
		// Area implementation for Rectangle
		return 0;
	}
	
}

class Circle extends Shape {

	@Override
	double area() {
		// Area implementation for Rectangle
		return 0;
	}
	
}

//Calculate Area
abstract class Shape {
	
	
	public double calculateArea(Shape[] shapes)
	{
		double area = 0;
		for(Shape shape:shapes) {
			area += shape.area();
		}
		return area;
	}
	
    abstract double area();
}
