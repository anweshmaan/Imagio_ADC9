The Interface Segregation Principle was defined by Robert C. Martin while consulting for Xerox to help them build the software for their new printer systems. He defined it as:
“Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.”

//Bad design

interface IPost
{
    void CreatePost();
}

interface IPostNew
{
    void CreatePost();
    void ReadPost();
}

//Good design
interface IPostCreate
{
    void CreatePost();
}

interface IPostRead
{
    void ReadPost();
}
